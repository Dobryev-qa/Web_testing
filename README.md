# 🛒 Web shop testing


I tested webstore https://demo.opencart.com/ and prepared different types of testing documentation:

- [Test plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qoOkI1wF4ztnLRoNR1oq6TjWcb81CRjBE-pM2HME3Sw/edit?usp=sharing) functional coverage (Navigation, Catalog, Search, Registration/Authorization, Cart)
- [Checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yjTzFHUSP0aX3yFRq8-RAvoxF9p5d-b8kG5MaO5bljg/edit?gid=735285630#gid=735285630) for testing the shopping cart and the payment module.
- [Test cases](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WlW5fHMRlT1sf2v2GnCE9sgXwVUudN3k/view?usp=sharing) Basic functional test cases for user and shopping flow, created in TestRail.
